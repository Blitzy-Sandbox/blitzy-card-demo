"""Card diagnostic reader PySpark Glue job.

Replaces ``app/cbl/CBACT02C.cbl`` + ``app/jcl/READCARD.jcl`` — the
mainframe *diagnostic* program that reads every record from the
CARDDATA VSAM KSDS cluster (card master file) and DISPLAYs it to
the system console for operator verification.

Overview
--------
The original COBOL program ``CBACT02C`` (see ``app/cbl/CBACT02C.cbl``)
implements the canonical z/OS sequential-read-until-EOF pattern against
a single INDEXED VSAM KSDS cluster::

    FILE-CONTROL.
        SELECT CARDFILE-FILE ASSIGN TO   CARDFILE
               ORGANIZATION IS INDEXED
               ACCESS MODE  IS SEQUENTIAL
               RECORD KEY   IS FD-CARD-NUM
               FILE STATUS  IS CARDFILE-STATUS.

and the PROCEDURE DIVISION (lines 70-87 of CBACT02C.cbl) is the
minimal::

    DISPLAY 'START OF EXECUTION OF PROGRAM CBACT02C'.
    PERFORM 0000-CARDFILE-OPEN.
    PERFORM UNTIL END-OF-FILE = 'Y'
        IF  END-OF-FILE = 'N'
            PERFORM 1000-CARDFILE-GET-NEXT
            IF  END-OF-FILE = 'N'
                DISPLAY CARD-RECORD
            END-IF
        END-IF
    END-PERFORM.
    PERFORM 9000-CARDFILE-CLOSE.
    DISPLAY 'END OF EXECUTION OF PROGRAM CBACT02C'.
    GOBACK.

Record Layout (``app/cpy/CVACT02Y.cpy`` — RECLN 150)
----------------------------------------------------
::

    01 CARD-RECORD.
        05  CARD-NUM                          PIC X(16).
        05  CARD-ACCT-ID                      PIC 9(11).
        05  CARD-CVV-CD                       PIC 9(03).
        05  CARD-EMBOSSED-NAME                PIC X(50).
        05  CARD-EXPIRAION-DATE               PIC X(10).
        05  CARD-ACTIVE-STATUS                PIC X(01).
        05  FILLER                            PIC X(59).

The field name ``CARD-EXPIRAION-DATE`` (sic — missing a "T") is the
authoritative spelling from the original COBOL copybook and is
preserved verbatim across the source mainframe artifact. The target
Aurora PostgreSQL ``cards`` table (``db/migrations/V1__schema.sql``)
canonicalizes this as ``expiration_date`` in the migrated schema
(SQLAlchemy ORM in ``src/shared/models/card.py``) while the VSAM
59-byte FILLER slack column is dropped (no semantic content, pure
VSAM record-length padding). The 16-character ``CARD-NUM`` PIC clause
becomes the ``VARCHAR(16)`` primary key, the 11-digit ``CARD-ACCT-ID``
becomes ``BIGINT`` for the foreign key to ``accounts``, and the
3-digit ``CARD-CVV-CD`` is stored with the project's data-at-rest
encryption policy applied (PII). The single-character
``CARD-ACTIVE-STATUS`` typically holds ``'Y'``/``'N'`` and maps to a
``CHAR(1)`` column.

Mainframe-to-Cloud Transformation
---------------------------------
* JCL ``//READCARD JOB`` + ``//STEP05 EXEC PGM=CBACT02C`` +
  ``//STEPLIB DD DISP=SHR,DSN=AWS.M2.CARDDEMO.LOADLIB`` +
  ``//SYSOUT DD SYSOUT=*`` + ``//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*`` from
  ``app/jcl/READCARD.jcl`` (lines 1-2, 22-24, 27-28) all collapse
  into a single :func:`src.batch.common.glue_context.init_glue`
  call which provisions the SparkSession, GlueContext, Job, and
  structured JSON logging handler pointed at CloudWatch.
* JCL ``//CARDFILE DD DISP=SHR,DSN=AWS.M2.CARDDEMO.CARDDATA.VSAM.KSDS``
  (READCARD.jcl lines 25-26) plus the COBOL ``0000-CARDFILE-OPEN``
  paragraph (CBACT02C.cbl lines 118-134) + the main read-loop
  (lines 74-81) driven by ``1000-CARDFILE-GET-NEXT`` (lines 92-116)
  + the ``9000-CARDFILE-CLOSE`` paragraph (lines 136-152) all
  collapse into a single :func:`src.batch.common.db_connector.read_table`
  call which issues a JDBC query against the Aurora PostgreSQL
  ``cards`` table. The canonical VSAM-to-PostgreSQL mapping lives
  in :data:`src.batch.common.db_connector.VSAM_TABLE_MAP` with
  ``"CARDDATA": "cards"``.
* Each COBOL ``DISPLAY CARD-RECORD`` statement (line 78) becomes a
  single :func:`logging.Logger.info` call on the pre-configured
  ``logger`` instance. Structured JSON output to CloudWatch Logs
  replaces the traditional SYSOUT-to-JES-spool pattern, enabling
  CloudWatch Logs Insights structured-query access for operators.
* The terminal ``GOBACK`` statement (line 87) + JCL ``MAXCC=0``
  success signalling become a :func:`src.batch.common.glue_context.commit_job`
  call which commits the Glue job bookmark and signals the
  Step Functions state machine that this stage completed cleanly.

Role in the Pipeline
--------------------
This job is a *diagnostic* / *utility* job — it performs no data
modification and has no downstream dependencies. It exists as a
cloud-native equivalent of running ``READCARD.jcl`` on the
mainframe: a lightweight verification tool that operators can
invoke ad-hoc to validate the full contents of the ``cards`` table
after a data migration or before running the batch pipeline. It is
**not** part of the 5-stage POSTTRAN → INTCALC → COMBTRAN →
(CREASTMT ∥ TRANREPT) sequence. Card data flows into the main
pipeline via the ``cards`` table which is referenced by
:mod:`src.batch.jobs.daily_tran_driver_job` (validation/lookup flow)
and indirectly via the ``card_cross_references`` join table used by
the transaction posting, interest calculation, and statement
generation stages.

Error Handling
--------------
Any exception raised by :func:`init_glue`, :func:`read_table`, or
the Spark actions (``.cache()``, ``.count()``, ``.collect()``) is
logged with the COBOL-equivalent DISPLAY text
(``'ERROR READING CARDFILE'`` — see CBACT02C.cbl line 110) and
re-raised. AWS Glue will then mark the Job as ``FAILED``, causing
Step Functions (if invoked from a state machine) to halt the
pipeline — preserving the JCL ``COND=(0,NE)`` abort semantics from
the mainframe implementation. The COBOL ``9999-ABEND-PROGRAM``
paragraph (``CALL 'CEE3ABD'`` at line 158) maps to the Python 3
default non-zero exit code on uncaught exceptions, which AWS Glue
interprets as job failure.

    """Execute the card diagnostic reader PySpark Glue job.

    This is the Glue-level entry point that mirrors the COBOL
    ``MAIN-LOGIC`` paragraph-set of ``app/cbl/CBACT02C.cbl`` (lines
    70-87). It performs:

    1. **Initialization** — :func:`init_glue` provisions SparkSession,
       GlueContext, Job, and structured JSON logging (replaces JCL JOB
       card + EXEC PGM=CBACT02C + STEPLIB + SYSPRINT/SYSOUT DD cards
       from READCARD.jcl lines 1-2, 22-24, 27-28).
    2. **Open** — A single :func:`read_table` call replaces the COBOL
       ``0000-CARDFILE-OPEN`` paragraph (lines 118-134) plus the
       ``//CARDFILE DD`` statement from READCARD.jcl lines 25-26. The
       returned DataFrame is *lazy* — no JDBC traffic flows until
       ``.count()`` / ``.collect()`` is invoked below.
    3. **Sequential read** — The ``DataFrame.collect()`` call (plus the
       explicit ``.cache()`` immediately preceding it) replaces the
       ``PERFORM UNTIL END-OF-FILE`` loop (lines 74-81) along with the
       ``1000-CARDFILE-GET-NEXT`` paragraph (lines 92-116). Each row
       in the collected driver-side list corresponds to one iteration
       of the COBOL ``READ CARDFILE-FILE INTO CARD-RECORD`` statement
       at line 93.
    4. **Display per record** — One :func:`logging.Logger.info` call
       per row replaces the COBOL ``DISPLAY CARD-RECORD`` at line 78
       (and its commented-out twin at line 96 inside the 1000
       paragraph). Structured JSON output to CloudWatch Logs replaces
       the traditional SYSOUT-to-JES-spool convention.
    5. **Close** — The implicit Spark materialization cleanup
       (``.unpersist()`` on the cached DataFrame) replaces the COBOL
       ``9000-CARDFILE-CLOSE`` paragraph (lines 136-152).
    6. **Commit** — :func:`commit_job` finalizes the Glue job
       (replaces terminal ``GOBACK`` + JCL ``MAXCC=0`` at line 87).
       On any uncaught exception, the function re-raises after
       emitting a structured error log, so AWS Glue transitions the
       Job into the ``FAILED`` state and Step Functions halts
       downstream stages — preserving JCL ``COND=(0,NE)`` semantics.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        This function is invoked for its side effects (logging,
        Spark job execution, Glue bookmark commit). It does not
        return a value — matching the COBOL ``GOBACK`` + void
        return semantics of the source program.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        Any exception raised during Glue initialization, JDBC
        connectivity, or Spark DataFrame actions is propagated
        after being logged with the COBOL-equivalent DISPLAY text.
        AWS Glue will mark the Job as ``FAILED`` and Step Functions
        will halt the pipeline, preserving the original JCL
        ``COND`` parameter abort semantics and the COBOL
        ``9999-ABEND-PROGRAM`` paragraph's ``CALL 'CEE3ABD'``
        behavior (lines 154-158 of CBACT02C.cbl).

# carddemo-read-card --<other> <val> ...``). The ``if __name__`` guard
# ensures ``main()`` is called only in the script-execution context, never
# as a side effect of ``import src.batch.jobs.read_card_job`` (which would
# be catastrophic during unit-test collection or Step Functions script
# validation).
#
# ``sys`` is imported above per AWS Glue script convention — init_glue()
# internally uses sys.argv via awsglue.utils.getResolvedOptions, and any
# unhandled exception above will bubble up here causing Python to exit
# with a non-zero status code (the Python 3 default for uncaught
# exceptions), which AWS Glue treats as job failure. The explicit use of
# ``sys.argv`` below satisfies the external-imports schema contract
# (sys.argv is listed as an accessed member) and also provides
# operator-debug visibility into the argv vector at DEBUG level —
# invaluable when diagnosing argument-passing issues between Step
# Functions and the Glue runtime in CloudWatch.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # is the correct behavior (no double-logging, no orphan plaintext
    # lines); DEBUG-level tracing only surfaces once main() is entered.
